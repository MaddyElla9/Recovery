# Ingredients
## Chicken
* 110g chicken breast (2 chicken breasts)
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/8 tsp black Pepper
* 1/8 tsp oregano
* 1/8 tsp cumin
* 1/8 tsp smoked paprika
* 1/8 tsp chilli
* 1/8 tsp onion powder
* 120ml low sodium chicken stock or water

## Other Ingredients
100g black beans
100g corn
70g mixed salad greens
370g cooked quinoa (about 2 cups)
1 avocado
10 cherry or grape tomatoes
1/2 lime
A few sprigs of cilantro, chopped

# Directions
## Step 1: 
Heat up olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and put in chicken. Season the top of the chicken with salt and pepper. Let it sear for 5 minutes.
## Step 2:
Flip the chicken, and add chicken stock and the rest of the spices. Cover and cook for 7-10 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165 °F / 75°C. 
You can check this using an instant read thermometer. Alternatively you can tell the chicken is cooked when the center is no longer pink.
## Step 3:
 Remove chicken from skillet and shred using two forks.
## Step 4:
While the chicken is cooking, prepare the rest of the ingredients. Cut tomatoes into halves, and slice avocado.
## Step 5:
Assemble your bowls by layering each one with salad greens, quinoa, tomatoes, shredded chicken, corn, black beans and avocado. Add a sprinkle of salt, pepper and smoked paprika. 
Finally, top with chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime.
