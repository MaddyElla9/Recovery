2 tbsp coconut yogurt
1 white nectarine (optional topping)
3 strawberries (optional topping)
3 raspberries (optional topping)
Handful of granola of choice (optional topping)

## Directions
# Step 1:
Prepare your toppings by cutting the nectarine and berries.

You may add a splash of coconut water/plant milk/water to assist with blending if it's difficult.
