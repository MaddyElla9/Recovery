# Ingredients
## Pesto:
1 bunch lacinato kale (about 12 ounces), stems removed and leaves torn into large pieces
1/2 cup unsalted cashews
2 cloves garlic, peeled
1/2 cup finely grated Parmesan or Romano
1/3 cup olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
Water, as needed, to thin the pesto
## Pasta:
1 pound whole wheat linguine, spaghetti, or bucatini.
2 to 3 tablespoons lemon juice, or to taste
8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 1-inch pieces

# Directions
## Step 1: 
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare a large bowl of ice water.
Add the kale to the boiling water and stir for 15 seconds, or until wilted and deep green. 
With a slotted spoon, transfer it to the bowl of ice water. (Alternatively, transfer to a colander and run it under cold water.) 
Reserve the cooking water in the pot. Squeeze the kale with your hands to remove excess water.
## Step 2:
In a food processor, pulse the cashews and garlic a few times until finely chopped. Add the kale and Parmesan, and pulse until they are also finely chopped. 
Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula as necessary. With the motor running, pour in the olive oil. Add the salt and pepper. 
If needed, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to bring the pesto to the desired thickness. Taste the pesto and add additional salt and pepper if needed.
## Step 3:
Return the pot of water used to blanch the kale to a boil. Add the pasta and cook for 7 to 10 minutes, until al dente. (Check the package for recommended cooking time.)
Scoop out and set aside 1 cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta in a colander.
## Step 4:
Return the pasta to the empty cooking pot and toss with the lemon juice. Add 1 cup or more pesto, to taste, and toss again. 
If the pesto seems dry, add a little of the pasta cooking water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the sauce coats the pasta. 
Stir in the mozzarella pieces and serve.
