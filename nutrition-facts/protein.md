# Protein

## Why is protein important?
Protein is good because when you are working out you are essentially tearing down your muscles. Proteins in the body work to build back the muscle 
and repair the tissue for the next time you work out.

## Where can I find protein in my foods?
Whole eggs, greek yogurt, lean red meats, poultry
