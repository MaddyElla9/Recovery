title: "Chocolate Chip Protein Cookies"
---

## Ingrdients
1/2 cup peanut butter or nut butter of choice
1/4 cup coconut sugar or light brown sugar
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 large egg
1 large egg white
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup vanilla whey protein powder
2 tablespoons coconut flour
3 tablespoons mini chocolate chips

# Directions 
## Step 1: 
Place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat the oven 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
## Step 2: 
In a medium bowl,, combine the peanut butter, coconut sugar, salt, egg, egg white, and vanilla extract. 
Mix until ingredients are well combined. Add in baking soda over the top. Using a rubber spatula, 
add in the protein powder and coconut flour until well combined. The consistency will seem on the drier side but continue to
stir and it will begin to come together. Now fold in the chocolate chips using the spatula
## Step 3: 
At this point, judge your dough, as the amount of moisture may vary based on the brand of protein powder and nut butter you use. 
It should be slightly sticky but not a total mushy mess. If you need a firmer dough, add a bit more protein powder. For a looser dough, 
sprinkle the batter with a bit of milk (or almond milk) and with a spatula, fold it in until the dough comes together.
## Step 4:
With a small cookie scoop or spoon, portion the cookie dough by tablespoonfuls and drop onto your prepared baking sheet 
(you will have 12 to 14 cookies total). With your fingers, gently flatten the tops of the cookies, 
as they will not spread but will puff up during baking. Bake for 5 to 6 minutes, until the edges are barely golden brown and 
dry to the touch but the middles seem fairly doughy. Do not overbake! Place the cookie sheet on a wire rack and allow the cookies to cool 
on the baking sheet for 3 minutes before transferring them directly to the wire rack to finish cooling.
